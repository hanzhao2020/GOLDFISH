# GOLDFISH
A Python library for **G**radient-based **O**ptimization, **L**arge-scale **D**esign **F**ramework for **I**sogeometric **SH**ells. This framework currently supports shape optimization for shell structures consisting of non-matching spline patches.

## Dependencies
1. [PENGoLINS](https://github.com/hanzhao2020/PENGoLINS) and its dependencies for structural analysis of isogeometric shells.

2. [OpenMDAO](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO) for multidisciplinary optimization.

3. Optional: [CSDL](https://github.com/LSDOlab/CSDL_alpha) and [CADDEE](https://github.com/LSDOlab/CADDEE_alpha) for building large-scale MDO aircraft models.
